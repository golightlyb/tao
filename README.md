# Tao - Total Avorion Overhaul

Tao is a work-in-progress total-conversion mod for [Avorion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/).

It's "headline features" are:

* less overwhelming loot system
* galaxy & combat overhaul
* massively better performance
* quality of life improvements

Features
----

* **inventory**
   - less focus on managing heaps of random loot
   - reduced trading goods from more than 150 to less than 50.
   - fewer weapons and subsystems, but with clearer roles
   - no randomised weapon or system bonuses or variants
   - main progression is material & rarity

* **performance**
  - plan cache system: better loading times and fewer stutters!
  - removed fighters
  - removed container fields
  - fewer wreckages
  - fewer but richer asteroids
  - some expensive shaders simplified
  - salvaged and mined materials appear directly in cargo bay if possible rather than becoming entities
  - fixed and improved wreckage cleanup script

* **combat**
  - fewer guns with clearer roles
  - fun coaxial weapons from the start
  - slowly-rotating main guns for battleship style combat
  - no "accumulatingBlockHealth" - [ships can now be broken in half]([https://www.reddit.com/r/avorion/comments/o8bnst/my_most_complex_centrally_armored_ships_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/avorion/comments/o8bnst/my_most_complex_centrally_armored_ships_this/h36f99e/))
  - vastly reduced turret slots, but...
    - weapons don't take up more slots as they get bigger
    - so you have fewer weapons
    - but as you progress those weapons can get bigger and better

* **story**
   - blank slate with existing story removed completely
   - may be extended by other mods in future
 
 * **overhaul**
   - completely new goods, systems, weapons, stations, events, sectors, etc.
  
 * **quality of life enhancements**
   - hidden stashes can now be interacted with at transporter range
   - some Avorion bug fixes

Status
------

WIP but should be playable.

Manually install to your mod folder only for now.

TODO
----

* Expand the plan cache system to stations for boosted loading speeds
* Remaining weapons and subsystems
* Additional sector types
* Torpedo overhaul
