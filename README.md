# Tao - Total Avorion Overhaul

Tao is a work-in-progress total-conversion mod for [Avorion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/).

Features
----

* **inventory**
   - less focus on managing heaps of random loot
   - reduced trading goods from more than 150 to just 35.
   - fewer weapons and subsystems, but with clearer roles
   - no randomised weapon or system bonuses or variants.
   - main progression is material & rarity
* **performance**
  - fighters removed entirely
* **combat**
  - fewer guns with clearer roles
  - fun coaxial weapons from the start
  - slowly-rotating main guns for battleship style combat
  - vastly reduced turret slots, but...
    - weapons don't take up more slots as they get bigger
    - so you have fewer weapons
    - but as you progress those weapons can get bigger and better
* **story**
   - blank slate with existing story removed completely

Status
------

WIP but should be playable.
Manually install to your mod folder only.

TODO

Weapons:

* Laser beam (turret only)
* Pulse beam (turret only); up to 33% chance to bypass shields depending on rarity; bonus vs tech blocks, very weak vs everything else
* Particle Lance (coaxial size 10 only)
* Point defense (laser, flak)
* Ion mines (basically a really slow but massive projectile)

Subsystems:

* Deflector (boost shield resistance against physical attacks, high energy cost)
* Polariser (boost shield resistance against disruptor, high energy cost)
* Reinforced armor refit (boost hull HP but decrease cargo space)
* Low armor refit (boost cargo space & acceleration but decrease hull HP)
* Chaff (manually activated anti-torpedo button with limited uses until recharged)
* Cloaking device (manually activated) ?
