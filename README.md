   - fewer weapons and subsystems, but with clearer roles

  - fixed and improved wreckage cleanup script

  - fewer guns with clearer roles
  - fun coaxial weapons from the start
  - slowly-rotating main guns for battleship style combat
  - no "accumulatingBlockHealth" - [ships can now be broken in half]([https://www.reddit.com/r/avorion/comments/o8bnst/my_most_complex_centrally_armored_ships_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/avorion/comments/o8bnst/my_most_complex_centrally_armored_ships_this/h36f99e/))
  - vastly reduced turret slots, but...
    - weapons don't take up more slots as they get bigger
    - so you have fewer weapons
    - but as you progress those weapons can get bigger and better

   - may be extended by other mods in future
 
 * **overhaul**
   - completely new goods, systems, weapons, stations, events, sectors, etc.

   - pirates only attack outer sectors
   - no Xsotan :p

 * **quality of life enhancements**
   - hidden stashes can now be interacted with at transporter range
   - some Avorion bug fixes

Known Issues
------------

### Can't refine newly mined ores or salvaged scrap in inventory

This is a priority to fix. In the mean time a workaround is to exit to menu and re-enter the game, at which point you can refine resources properly.

### Can't sell newly purchased equipment back to spacedock

Close the spacedock dialog then open it again. The sell tab will now be populated properly.

### Additional damage resistance shows as a weakness instead

This is merely a cosmetic issue with Avorion. Rest assured that weapons testing has verified that the resistance is still applied as intended.

### Can I support the project?

Yes!

* Graphics - can you make promotional graphics e.g. a logo for the mod? Can you make models that can appear in the universe?
* Video making - can you make a video of you playing the mod?

* Programming - pull requests are welcome! (I'll actually unzip the files at some point; I don't normally develop on Windows so don't have git installed...)
