# Tao - Total Avorion Overhaul

Toa is a work-in-progress total-conversion mod for [Avorion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/).

Goal
----

* less focus on managing heaps of random loot
   - fewer mob drops
   - no special weapon variants e.g. no random "plus %x against shields"
   - reduce the 52 "tech levels" into fewer buckets
   - main progression is weapon rarity, size, and type e.g. barrel count
* better performance
* combat rebalance
  - fewer weapons and subsystems, but with clearer roles
  - meaningful big, slow, high recoil main guns
  - fun coaxial weapons from the start
  - shields are always impenetrable to most weapons (excl. torpedos)
  - vastly reduced turret slots
    - BUT: bigger sized guns don't take up more slots
  - meaningful weapon types e.g. double-cannons are always better than single-cannons
  - fighters removed entirely
* fewer goods types
* remove the story / alternate story

Status
------

WIP but should be playable.
Manually install to your mod folder only.

Current Features
---------------

* All vanilla weapons and subsystems removed
* Some new weapons and subsystems

Weapons
-------

Implemented:

* Autocannon (coaxial only)
* Artillery (turret only, slow rotation, high damage vs hull)
* Micro-Missile launcher (coaxial only, seeking)
* Disruptor (coaxial only, high damage vs shields)

Planned:

* Laser beam (turret only)
* Pulse beam (turret only); up to 33% chance to bypass shields depending on rarity; bonus vs tech blocks, very weak vs everything else
* Particle Lance (coaxial size 10 only)
* Point defense (laser, flak)
* Ion mines (basically a really slow but massive projectile)

Subsystems
-----------

* Ship core (one-per-ship) - basic system that adds a modest starting ammount of everything

Planned:

* Deflector (boost shield resistance against physical attacks, high energy cost)
* Polariser (boost shield resistance against disruptor, high energy cost)
* Reinforced armor refit (boost hull HP but decrease cargo space)
* Low armor refit (boost cargo space & acceleration but decrease hull HP)
* Chaff (manually activated anti-torpedo button with limited uses until recharged)
* Cloaking device (manually activated) ?
